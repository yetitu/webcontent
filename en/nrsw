      "text": "The NetModule router software (NRSW) is our standard software and runs on all our devices. This has the advantage of being able to use identical configuration processes and functions for every router (unless technical restrictions dictate otherwise). It is based on proven components such as Embedded Linux and a powerful communication protocol suite."

    {

      "text": "Routing options include static routes, multipath, OSPF, BGP, and more. Mobile IP permits switching from one network to the next while retaining a permanent IP address. Quality of Service (QoS) and various firewall options are also available. For secure connections to remote locations, the NRSW offers VPN protocols such as OpenVPN or IPSec."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "An important feature is the Software Development Kit (SDK), which allows you to write your own scripts and functions for the router. It contains extensive functions for accessing hardware interfaces – to retrieve system status parameters, send email or SMS, or perform router configuration tasks."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "text": "The NRSW also supports Linux Containers (LXC) in case additional applications are to be integrated. The containers allow processes and process groups to be isolated by virtualizing kernel resources and shielding them from each other. With LXC you can launch single applications or whole Linux distributions in a container. Containers separate user and router applications particularly efficiently for the secure execution of both applications."
