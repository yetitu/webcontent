If at least one PoE+ supported network switch (such as ES3300) and at least two AP3400s are installed in the wagon, a very effective WiFi coverage area is created in the entire wagon."

      "text": "AP3400 can be done with the help of NetModule Router Software (NRSW) on a NetModule router on the train. The NetModule router actually also acts as a provisioning controller for the AP3400. NetModule Router Software comes with a comprehensive set of networking features. The AP3400 can also be configured with the remote management system called Connectivity Suite, via the REST API interface or the device's own web interface."

Since it is part of WiFi 6, the transmitted data is protected from the prying eyes of others."

To ensure optimum passenger flow, for example, the boarding area on trains is designed to be large; This leaves less and less space for technical components. Thanks to its flat and compact design, the AP3400 can be installed easily and space-savingly."

      "text": "The AP3400 is preferably used with an NB3800 series router and ES3300 network switch to create a redundant Gigabit IP backbone with ring topology. Additionally, the AP3400's power supply can be managed by the ES3300 network switch with Power over Ethernet, PoE+ (IEEE 802.3 at). This can save up to 50% on cabling costs because data and power are transmitted over the same Ethernet cable."

      "text": "Along with the NB3800 series router, the AP3400 can be configured from the router thanks to the REST API. Quick and easy commissioning (Auto Discovery) of all devices, including the network switch and access point, can be done via NetModule Router Software, Connectivity Suite or the graphical user interface on the AP3400. Connectivity Suite allows easy deployment (deployment and management) of multiple devices across multiple vehicles. This wireless configuration (OTA, Over-the-air) of all system components saves time and money and provides the perfect all-in-one solution for passenger WiFi and passenger infotainment systems."
