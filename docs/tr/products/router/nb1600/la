  "overview": [
    "NB1601-La is a low-cost solution for Condition Monitoring, Automation and Remote Management. Its small form factor and reduced features make it ideal for simple connection tasks. Among its features; It includes a 4G LTE 450 supported GSM module, serial interface, digital I/Os and four Ethernet ports for high-speed mobile Internet connection.",
    "The high-quality metal housing for DIN rail mounting offers the required ruggedness for use in industrial environments with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to 70 °C.",
    "The software is based on proven components, including a built-in Linux operating system and a powerful communications protocol suite, as well as VPN technologies such as OpenVPN. Customer-specific software extensions can be implemented via an advanced SDK."
