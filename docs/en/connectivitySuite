      "text": "The Connectivity Suite ('CS' for short) is web-based and modular. It allows system administrators to configure and monitor all devices, while a technician can only interfere with the devices of the network under his responsibility. It allows multiple hosted networks to be logically grouped and isolated from each other on a single platform."

      "text": "Each network receives service from its own VPN server. After a simple initial configuration and certificate assignment, all routers are automatically connect to their VPN server. Thus, you do not have to deal with individual IP addresses and certificates. It creates an automatic and secure communication environment between the server of the CS program and the hosted networks and devices, using techniques with proven cryptographic capabilities such as OpenVPN, SSL or IPsec."

The date and time at which firmware and configuration updates will start automatically can be set in advance. The connection status of all networks and all devices hosted on the platform is constantly monitored and displayed on the control panel."

By being powerful enough for projects with hundreds of devices, Connectivity Suite guarantees a sustainable investment. The platform can also be installed on-premises for ensuring the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the data and information flows."

      "description": "In rapidly growing networks, maintenance processes such as updating the 'Internet of Things' ('IoT') devices and softwares, changing the configuration settings have become a complex and challenging subject. Configuring each device on the network individually on-site can be extremely expensive. Managing large networks may cost a lot of effort and money. You will not experience these problems in your network with 'Connectivity Suite'."

      "description": "The routers are always in motion with the vehicles and are often difficult to access. Configuring new routers in vehicles and managing repairs and replacements for faulty devices are difficult. Connectivity Suite helps you to remotely manage your routers and connected devices (such as ticket vending machines, computers, cameras) in vehicles. It doesn't matter if the router is installed on a trolleybus, subway, tram or bus."

      "description": "By automatically updating the routers in your network from the center, you can be sure that you always get the best performance from your network. The monitoring platform constantly monitors the connection status of devices and networks. This feature provides reliable monitoring of installed devices. When a bus or tram network fails, it proactively notifies the user about the network change in their fleet."

It manages the automatic execution of software and configuration updates. All devices in the fleet can be remotely configured at once. It is enough for field technicians to physically install the hardware. Software updates and configuration processes of the device will be managed remotely later."
