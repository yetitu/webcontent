  "overview": [
    "Antenna-Coach-4NG is a versatile combo antenna ideal for signal enhancement in 5G mobile and GNSS. ECE-R 118 is specially designed according to combustion behavior and can be used in the internal structures of motor vehicles. The antenna combines four 5G antennas, four WiFi antennas and one active GPS antenna in a single housing, thus supporting 4x4 MIMO 5G as well as GNSS (GPS & GLONASS). 5G is linear and active GNSS is right circular polarized.",
    "The antenna is RoHS, REAch and ECE-R 118 compliant and has an IP69K protection level (mounted) and is suitable for indoor and outdoor use in harsh environments, with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C. The antenna can be permanently mounted with screws and the two supplied 3 m cables allow flexible positioning."
