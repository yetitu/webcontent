  "overview": [
    "Antenna-Coach-4L4W is a versatile combo antenna ideal for signal improvement in 5G mobile and WiFi networks. ECE-R 118 is specially designed according to combustion behavior and can be used in the internal structures of motor vehicles. The antenna combines four 5G antennas and four WiFi antennas in a single housing, thus supporting 4x4 MIMO 5G and 4x4 MIMO WiFi 2.4/5 GHz. 5G and Wi-Fi are linear polarized.",
    "The antenna is RoHS, REAch and ECE-R 118 compliant and has an IP69K protection level (mounted) and is suitable for indoor and outdoor use in harsh environments, with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C. The antenna can be permanently mounted with screws and the two supplied 3 m cables allow flexible positioning."
