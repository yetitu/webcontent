  "overview": [
    "Antenna-Coach-2L is an omnidirectional antenna for signal improvement in mobile networks. ECE-R 118 is specially designed according to combustion behavior and can be used in the internal structures of motor vehicles. Combines two LTE radios in a single enclosure. In this way, MIMO supports LTE.",
    "The antenna is RoHS, REAch and ECE-R 118 compliant and has an IP69K protection level (mounted) and is suitable for indoor and outdoor use in harsh environments, with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C. The antenna can be permanently mounted with screws and the two supplied 3 m cables allow flexible positioning."
