  "overview": [
    "Antenna-Coach-Indoor-2W is an omni-directional combo antenna designed for signal improvement in WiFi networks. ECE-R 118 is specially designed according to combustion behavior and can be used in the internal structures of motor vehicles. The antenna combines two WiFi antennas in a single housing and thus supports MIMO WiFi 2.4/5 GHz. WiFi is linear polarized.",
    "The antenna is RoHS, REAch and ECE-R 118 compliant and has an IP69K protection level (mounted) and is suitable for indoor and outdoor use in harsh environments, with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C. The antenna can be permanently mounted with screws and the two supplied 3 m cables allow flexible positioning."
