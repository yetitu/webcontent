  "overview": [
    "Antenna-Coach-2L2WG is a versatile combo antenna designed for signal enhancement in mobile, WiFi networks and GNSS. ECE-R 118 is specially designed according to combustion behavior and can be used in the internal structures of motor vehicles. The antenna combines two LTE antennas, two Wi-Fi antennas and one active GPS antenna in a single housing and thus supports MIMO LTE, MIMO WiFi 2.4/5 GHz as well as GNSS (GPS & GLONASS). LTE and WiFi are linear and active GNSS is right circular polarized.",
    "The antenna is RoHS, REAch and ECE-R 118 compliant and has an IP69K protection level (mounted) and is suitable for indoor and outdoor use in harsh environments, with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C. The antenna can be permanently mounted with screws and the two supplied 3 m cables allow flexible positioning."
