  "overview": [
    "The Antenna-Railway-4N is an omnidirectional multiband train antenna with certification according to railway standard EN 50155 for mounting on trains and vehicles. The antenna is designed for 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G and also GSM-R networks. With protection level IPX9k and supported temperature range from -60 째C to +85 째C, the antenna can be used on top of vehicles for train to ground communications and much more.",
    "The antenna combines multiple antennas in a single housing and thus supports MIMO 4x4 5G/LTE/UMTS/GSM/GSM-R. The antenna can be mounted permanently with six bolts."
