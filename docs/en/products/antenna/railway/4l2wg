  "overview": [
    "The Antenna-Railway-4L2WG is an omnidirectional multiband train antenna with certification according to railway standard EN 50155 for mounting on trains and vehicles. The antenna is designed for 2G, 3G, 4G and also GSM-R networks, for WiFi and also GNSS. With protection level IPX9k and supported temperature range from -60 °C to +80 °C, the antenna can be used on top of vehicles for train to ground communications and much more.",
    "The antenna combines multiple antennas in a single housing and thus supports MIMO 4x4 LTE/UMTS/GSM/GSM-R, MIMO WiFi 2.4/5 GHz and GNSS (GPS & GLONASS) with amplifier. The antenna can be mounted permanently with six bolts and the bundle includes seven 3m cables."
