  "overview": [
    "The Antenna-Roof-2L2WG is an omnidirectional combo antenna for signal enhancement in mobile and WiFi networks and GNSS. It can be used for weather stations, water supplies, fleet management applications and much more. The antenna combines two LTE antennas, two WiFi antennas and an active GPS antenna in a single housing and thus supports MIMO LTE/UMTS/GSM, MIMO WiFi 2.4/5 GHz and also GNSS (GPS & GLONASS). LTE and WiFi are linear and the active GNSS is right hand circular polarized.",
    "The antenna is RoHS compliant and with protection level IP67 (waterproof) and supported temperature range from -40 °C to +80 °C it is suited for indoor and outdoor usage in harsh environments. The antenna can be mounted permanently with screws and five included 1m cables allow a flexible positioning."
