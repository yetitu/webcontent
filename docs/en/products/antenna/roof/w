  "overview": [
    "The Antenna-Roof-W is an omnidirectional combo antenna for signal enhancement in WiFi networks. It can be used for creating a WiFi coverage inside a facility or accessing an access point outside of the facility. The antenna supports MIMO WiFi 2.4/5 GHz. WiFi is linear polarized.",
    "The antenna is RoHS and REACH compliant and with protection level IP69K (waterproof) and supported temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C it is suited for indoor and outdoor usage in harsh environments. The antenna can be mounted permanently with screws and four included 3m cables allow a flexible positioning."
