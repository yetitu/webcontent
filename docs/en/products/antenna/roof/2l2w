  "overview": [
    "The Antenna-Roof-2L2W is an omnidirectional combo antenna for signal enhancement in mobile and WiFi networks. It can be used for weather stations, remote management and much more. The antenna combines two LTE antennas and two WiFi antennas in a single housing and thus supports MIMO LTE/UMTS/GSM and MIMO WiFi 2.4/5 GHz. LTE and WiFi are linear polarized.",
    "The antenna is RoHS compliant and with protection level IP67 (waterproof) and supported temperature range from -40 °C to +80 °C it is suited for indoor and outdoor usage in harsh environments. The antenna can be mounted permanently with screws and four included 3m cables allow a flexible positioning."
