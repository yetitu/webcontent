  "overview": [
    "The Antenna-Roof-2L is an omnidirectional antenna with linear polarization for signal enhancement 4G / 3G and 2G networks. It can be used in telematics, for weather stations, switch cabinets and much more.",
    "Incorporating two separately fed ultra-wideband elements in a single housing, the antenna is equipped to provide client-side MIMO. The antenna can be mounted permanently with screws and two included 3m cables allow a flexible positioning."
