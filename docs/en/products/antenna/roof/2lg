  "overview": [
    "The Antenna-Roof-2LG is an omnidirectional combo antenna for signal enhancement in 4G, 3G and 2G networks and GNSS (GPS & GLONASS). It can be used for weather stations, water supplies, fleet management applications and much more. The antenna combines two LTE antennas and an active GPS antenna in a single housing and thus supports MIMO LTE, UMTS, GSM and also GNSS. The LTE’s are linear and the active GNSS is right hand circular polarized.",
    "With protection level IP67 (waterproof) and with supported temperature range from -40 °C to +80 °C it is suited for indoor and outdoor usage in harsh environments. The antenna can be mounted permanently with screws and three included 3m cables allow a flexible positioning."
