  "title": "NB3800-3LpDf-GVi",
  "description": "It is a high-performance and modular mobile router that provides wireless internet access in vehicles operating on railways.",
  "heroText": "It is ideal for operators and vehicle manufacturers in the railway transportation sector who want to provide their passengers with a comfortable travel experience while also increasing their operational efficiency with new generation fleet management.",

  "overview": [
    "NB3800-3LpDf-GVi is produced for vehicles used to carry passengers and freight on railways. It is generally used to enable the vehicle to connect to the internet without interruption. It is equipped with 3 GSM modules with LTE-A Pro support, a 1 TB SSD, GNSS for positioning, 2 Gigabit and 3 Fast Ethernet ports.",
    "Complies with regulations 2014/53/EU (RED), 2011/65/EU(RoHS), EN 50155 class OT4/ST0 and EN 45545.",
    "With its numerous features and high performance; It is the ideal device for applications such as 'WiFi for Passengers', 'Passenger Infotainment System', 'Fleet Management' or 'Security Cameras'. ",
    "The embedded Linux operating system, developed according to its intended use, has proven software components, including advanced communication protocols. Custom applications can be developed using the free Software Development Kit (SDK)."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "LTE-A Pro represents a more advanced and capable iteration of LTE, delivering significantly higher speeds, lower latency, and improved network efficiency. While LTE is still widely used, LTE-A Pro serves as a crucial step forward in meeting the increasing demands for faster and more reliable wireless connectivity. Having three LTE-A Pros provides backup for a faster and uninterrupted internet connection.",
    "With 1 TB SSD (Solid State Disk) disk capacity, critical information such as time-stamped location/speed records or security video recordings can be stored for a long time. Since there are no moving parts in SSD disks, data is stored safely even in vibrating environments that vehicles are exposed to.",
    "All models of the NB3800 series router are equipped with a dual-core CPU clocked at 1.3 GHz and 1 GB of RAM memory. NSRW software, which gives all the capabilities of the router, runs on this computer with Linux operating system. A virtual computer isolated from NSRW is created with the help of LXC (Linux Container) technology. Thus, special software applications can be developed using the advanced SDK and preferred programming language that provides access to the functions of the router.",
    "It is resistant to the harsh physical conditions that vehicles produced for passenger and freight transportation on railways will encounter. It has an IP40 level protected design. It operates between -25°C and +70°C.",
    "Advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. The minimum number of satellites that need to be fixed for high accuracy in position determination can be programmed.",
    "The device is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet and 3 Fast Ethernet ports. In this way, it creates a wired local area network (LAN) within the vehicle. It can be used for internet access of other devices with Ethernet interface in the vehicle (such as vehicle computer, validator).",
    "Complies with regulations 2014/53/EU (RED), 2011/65/EU(RoHS), EN 50155 class OT4/ST0 and EN 45545."
