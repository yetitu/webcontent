  "overview": [
    "NB3800-2Lp-G is produced for vehicles used to carry passengers and freight on railways. It is generally used to enable the vehicle to connect to the internet without interruption. It is equipped with 2 GSM modules with LTE-A Pro support, GNSS for positioning, 2 Gigabit and 3 Fast Ethernet ports. ",
    "Complies with regulations 2014/53/EU (RED), 2011/65/EU(RoHS), EN 50155 class OT4/ST0 and EN 45545.",
    "With its numerous features and high performance; It is the ideal device for applications such as 'WiFi for Passengers', 'Passenger Infotainment System', 'Fleet Management' or 'Security Cameras'. ",
    "The embedded Linux operating system, developed according to its intended use, has proven software components, including advanced communication protocols. Custom applications can be developed using the free Software Development Kit (SDK)."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "LTE-A Pro represents a more advanced and capable iteration of LTE, delivering significantly higher speeds, lower latency, and improved network efficiency. While LTE is still widely used, LTE-A Pro serves as a crucial step forward in meeting the increasing demands for faster and more reliable wireless connectivity. Having two LTE-A Pros provides backup for a faster and uninterrupted internet connection.",
    "It is resistant to the harsh physical conditions that vehicles produced for passenger and freight transportation on railways will encounter. It has an IP40 level protected design. It operates between -40°C and +70°C.",
    "Advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. The minimum number of satellites that need to be fixed for high accuracy in position determination can be programmed.",
    "The device is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet and 3 Fast Ethernet ports. In this way, it creates a wired local area network (LAN) within the vehicle. It can be used for internet access of other devices with Ethernet interface in the vehicle (such as vehicle computer, validator).",
    "Complies with regulations 2014/53/EU (RED), 2011/65/EU(RoHS), EN 50155 class OT4/ST0 and EN 45545."
