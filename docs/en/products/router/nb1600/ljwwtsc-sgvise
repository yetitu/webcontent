  "heroText": "Economical mobile router for Condition Monitoring, Automation and Remote Management applications",
  "front_image": "nb1600_front.png",
  "overview": [
    "As a special feature, the industrial router offers four Ethernet ports, which are highly configurable. It is also equipped with digital I/Os, serial interfaces, GNSS receiver and an USB 2.0 port. Additionally, there is an LTE module and a small WLAN access point.",
    "The high-quality metal housing, which is suitable for DIN rail mounting, in combination with the supported temperature range of -40 °C to 70 °C, offers the ruggedness required for use in industrial environments. Thus, with the versatile features, the NB1601 is suitable for applications such as Condition Monitoring, Industrial Security and Remote Management.",
    "The software is based on well proven components including an embedded Linux operating system and a powerful communication protocol suite as well as VPN technologies as OpenVPN. Customer specific software extensions may be implemented via a sophisticated SDK."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "Cellular network connection is established with the Multimode GSM module, which supports 4G- LTE, 3G- DC-HSPA+/UMTS and 2G- GSM/GPRS/EDGE networks.",
    "It is resistant to harsh physical conditions with its IP40 level protected design. It operates between -40°C and +70°C.",
    "The device is equipped with four Fast Ethernet (10/100 Mbps) ports (RJ45).",
    "It has certificates of compliance with CE (2014/53/EU, RED), 2011/65/EU (RoHS), UKCA 2017/1206 (RER) and UL/IEC/EN 62368-1 directives."
