  "overview": [
    "NB1800-LWac provides fast Internet access in an industrial environment. For a reliable network connection, the device has a 4G-LTE supported GSM module. It also has a WiFi-5 supporting radio, two Gigabit Ethernet and one SFP port (for Fiber optic connection), as well as a USB port and a serial interface that can be operated in RS-232/485 modes.",
    "The high-quality metal housing for DIN rail mounting offers the required ruggedness for use in industrial environments with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +70 °C.",
    "The software is based on proven components, including a built-in Linux operating system and a powerful communications protocol suite, as well as VPN technologies such as OpenVPN. Customer-specific software extensions can be implemented via an advanced SDK."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "The device has a GSM module that supports 4G LTE. Having 2 SIM card slots provides the opportunity to connect to different cellular networks. This helps both control mobile internet costs and establish an uninterrupted internet connection.",
    "One radio that supports WLAN-ac allows creating a wireless local area network (WLAN, WiFi) and connecting as a client to other available WiFi access points. It can be operated at different frequencies (2.4 GHz and 5GHz).",
    "With its IP40 level protected design, it is resistant to harsh physical conditions. It operates between -40°C and +70°C.",
    "The device is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000 Mbps, 2xRJ45) and one SFP port."
