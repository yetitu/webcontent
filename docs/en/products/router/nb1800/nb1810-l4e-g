  "overview": [
    "NB1810-L4E-G provides fast Internet access in an industrial environment. For a reliable network connection, the device has a GSM module with 4G-LTE support. It also features a four-port Gigabit Ethernet switch and a configurable SFP/GbE port, as well as a USB port and a serial interface that can be operated in RS-232/485 modes.",
    "The high-quality metal housing for DIN rail mounting offers the required ruggedness for use in industrial environments with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +70 °C.",
    "The software is based on proven components, including a built-in Linux operating system and a powerful communications protocol suite, as well as VPN technologies such as OpenVPN. Customer-specific software extensions can be implemented via an advanced SDK."
  ],
  "keyFeatures": [
    "The device has a GSM module that supports 4G LTE. Having 2 SIM card slots provides the opportunity to connect to different cellular networks. This helps both control mobile internet costs and establish an uninterrupted internet connection.",
    "With its IP40 level protected design, it is resistant to harsh physical conditions. It operates between -40°C and +70°C.",
    "Advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. Up to three satellites can be fixed for high accuracy in positioning.",
    "The device is equipped with 4 PoE+ supported Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000 Mbps, 4xRJ45) switches, one adjustable SFP/GbE and one GbE port."
