  "overview": [
    "NB1800-Lp-G provides fast Internet access in an industrial environment. For a reliable network connection, the device has a GSM module with 4G-LTE-A Pro support. It also has two Gigabit Ethernet and one SFP port (for Fiber optic connection), as well as a USB port and a serial interface that can be operated in RS-232/485 modes.",
    "The high-quality metal housing for DIN rail mounting offers the required ruggedness for use in industrial environments with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +70 °C.",
    "The software is based on proven components, including a built-in Linux operating system and a powerful communications protocol suite, as well as VPN technologies such as OpenVPN. Customer-specific software extensions can be implemented via an advanced SDK."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "LTE-A Pro represents a more advanced and capable iteration of LTE, delivering significantly faster speeds, lower latency and improved network efficiency. In an environment where LTE is still widely used, LTE-A Pro serves as an important step in meeting growing demands for faster and more reliable wireless connectivity.",
    "With its IP40 level protected design, it is resistant to harsh physical conditions. It operates between -40°C and +70°C.",
    "Advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. Up to three satellites can be fixed for high accuracy in positioning.",
    "The device is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000 Mbps, 2xRJ45) and one SFP port."
