  "overview": [
    "NB1800-NWac-G provides fast Internet access in an industrial environment. For a reliable network connection, the device has a GSM module with 5G-NR support. It also has a WiFi-5 supporting radio, two Gigabit Ethernet and one SFP port (for Fiber optic connection), as well as a USB port and a serial interface that can be operated in RS-232/485 modes.",
    "The high-quality metal housing for DIN rail mounting offers the required ruggedness for use in industrial environments with a supported temperature range of -40 °C to +70 °C.",
    "The software is based on proven components, including a built-in Linux operating system and a powerful communications protocol suite, as well as VPN technologies such as OpenVPN. Customer-specific software extensions can be implemented via an advanced SDK."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "With 5G-NR, it provides access to high speeds at frequencies below 1 GHz in rural areas and at frequencies between 26-28 GHz in high-density urban areas. Data download (DL) speed can be up to 5.5 Gbps, and data upload (UL) speed can be up to 2.7 Gbps.",
    "One radio that supports WLAN-ac allows creating a wireless local area network (WLAN, WiFi) and connecting as a client to other available WiFi access points. It can be operated at different frequencies (2.4 GHz and 5GHz).",
    "With its IP40 level protected design, it is resistant to harsh physical conditions. It operates between -40°C and +70°C.",
    "Advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. Up to three satellites can be fixed for high accuracy in positioning."
