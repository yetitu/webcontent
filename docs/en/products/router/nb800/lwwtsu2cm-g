  "overview": [
    "NB800-LWWtSu2Cm-G is the cost-effective solution for a robust Internet connection in an industrial environment. The small form factor and reduced features make it ideal for simple connectivity tasks. Its features include an LTE module for wireless Internet connection, a small WiFi access point with Bluetooth LE, two passive CAN interfaces and an Ethernet port.",
    "The high-quality metal housing, which is suitable for DIN rail mounting, in combination with the supported temperature range of -40 °C to 70 °C, offers the ruggedness required for use in industrial environments. The NB800 withstands mechanical and thermal stress. This, and its features, make the NB800 suitable for applications such as Condition Monitoring, Remote Management, Environmental Monitoring and Point of Sales.",
    "The software is based on well proven components including an embedded Linux operating system and a powerful communication protocol suite as well as VPN technologies as OpenVPN. Customer specific software extensions may be implemented via a sophisticated SDK."
