  "title": "NB2810-2L2Wac-GIx",
  "description": "It is a high-performance and modular mobile router that provides wireless internet access in vehicles operating on highways.",
  "heroText": "It is ideal for public transport operators and vehicle manufacturers who want to increase operational efficiency with new generation fleet management while providing their passengers with a comfortable travel experience.",
  "front_image": "nb2800_front.jpg",
  "overview": [
    "NB2810-2L2Wac-GIx not only provides in-vehicle wireless Internet access but also meet ITxPT requirements for fleet management. The router is equipped with two GSM Modules, WiFi access points with the latest IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) standard, GNSS for positioning and 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports with M12 connectors.",
    "Thanks to the integrated ignition detection, the NB2810 can remain switched on even after the vehicle has been switched off. This allows the safe completion of all tasks.",
    "The router meets the UNECE-R10 (E-Mark), UNECE-R118 regulations and the FAKRA connectors according to ITxPT. This, combined with its numerous features and high performance, makes it the ideal communication gateway for applications such as Passenger WiFi, Telematics, Fleet Management or CCTV.",
    "The software is based on well proven components including an embedded Linux operating system and a powerful communication protocol suite. Customer specific software extensions may be implemented via a sophisticated SDK."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "Two GSM modules supporting 4G LTE in the device can establish two cellular network connections at the same time. Having 4 SIM card slots provides the opportunity to connect to different cellular networks. This helps both control mobile internet costs and establish an uninterrupted internet connection.",
    "Two radios that support WLAN-ac allow creating a wireless local area network (WLAN, WiFi) inside the vehicle at the same time and connecting as clients to WiFi access points outside the vehicle. Radios can be operated at different frequencies (2.4GHz and 5GHz). Two WLANs with different SSIDs can be created in the vehicle at different or the same frequencies.",
    "With ITxPT compatibility, vehicle manufacturers can easily develop new generation innovative applications such as FMStoIP, VEHICLEtoIP",
    "It is resistant to the harsh physical conditions that vehicles produced for passenger and freight transportation will encounter. It has an IP40 level protected design. It operates between -25°C and +70°C.",
    "The advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. The minimum number of satellites that need to be fixed for high accuracy in position determination can be programmed.",
    "The device is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet ports for creating a local area network (LAN) within the vehicle. The RJ45 port in the vehicle can be used for internet access of other devices with Ethernet interface (such as vehicle computer, validator).",
    "Thanks to the integrated ignition detection, the router can remain powered on for the time you specify after the vehicle is turned off. Thus, the device safely completes its tasks.",
    "It has certificates of conformity with CE (2014/53/EU, RED), UN ECE R10, UN ECE R118 directives."
