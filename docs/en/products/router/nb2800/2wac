  "title": "NB2800-2Wac",
  "description": "It is a high-performance and modular mobile router that provides wireless internet access in vehicles operating on highways.",
  "heroText": "It is ideal for public transport operators and vehicle manufacturers who want to increase operational efficiency with new generation fleet management while providing their passengers with a comfortable travel experience.",
  "front_image": "nb2800_front.jpg",
  "overview": [
    "NB2800-2Wac is produced for vehicles used to carry passengers and cargo on highways.",
    "It is equiped with two WiFi access points with IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) standard and two Gigabit Ethernet ports.",
    "Complies with UNECE-R10 (E-Mark) and UNECE-R118 regulations. With its numerous features and high performance; It is the ideal router for applications such as WiFi for Passengers, Passenger Infotainment System, Fleet Management or Security Cameras.",
    "The embedded Linux operating system, developed according to its intended use, has proven software components, including advanced communication protocols. Custom applications can be developed using the free Software Development Kit (SDK)."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "Two radios that support WLAN-ac allow creating a wireless local area network (WLAN, WiFi) inside the vehicle at the same time and connecting as clients to WiFi access points outside the vehicle. Radios can be operated at different frequencies (2.4GHz and 5GHz). Two WLANs with different SSIDs can be created in the vehicle at different or the same frequencies.",
    "It is resistant to the harsh physical conditions that vehicles produced for passenger and freight transportation will encounter. It has an IP40 level protected design. It operates between -25°C and +70°C.",
    "The device is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet ports for creating a local area network (LAN) within the vehicle. The RJ45 port in the vehicle can be used for internet access of other devices with Ethernet interface (such as vehicle computer, validator).",
    "Thanks to the integrated ignition detection, the router can remain powered on for the time you specify after the vehicle is turned off. Thus, the device safely completes its tasks.",
    "It has certificates of conformity with CE (2014/53/EU, RED), UN ECE R10, UN ECE R118 directives."
