  "overview": [
    "NB2800-4L-GV is produced for vehicles used to carry passengers and cargo. It is used to enable the vehicle to be connected to the internet seamlessly and to provide voice communications in the vehicle.",
    "It is equipped with four GSM modules with 4G-LTE support, GNSS for positioning and two Gigabit Ethernet ports and voice gateway functionality which enables 3 simultaneous calls.",
    "Complies with UNECE-R10 (E-Mark) and UNECE-R118 regulations. With its numerous features and high performance; It is the ideal router for applications such as VoIP, Fleet Management or Security Cameras.",
    "The embedded Linux operating system, developed according to its intended use, has proven software components, including advanced communication protocols. Custom applications can be developed using the free Software Development Kit (SDK)."

  "keyFeatures": [
    "Four GSM modules supporting 4G LTE in the device can establish four cellular network connections at the same time. Having 4 SIM card slots provides the opportunity to connect to different cellular networks. This helps both control mobile internet costs and establish an uninterrupted internet connection.",
    "Voice communication in public transportation is vital for safety, coordination, and efficiency. It ensures quick response to emergencies, facilitates driver-dispatcher communication, and enhances passenger safety and service quality.",
    "It is resistant to the harsh physical conditions that vehicles produced for passenger and freight transportation will encounter. It has an IP40 level protected design. It operates between -25°C and +70°C.",
    "The advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. The minimum number of satellites that need to be fixed for high accuracy in position determination can be programmed.",
    "Thanks to the integrated ignition detection, the router can remain powered on for the time you specify after the vehicle is turned off. Thus, the device safely completes its tasks.",
    "It has certificates of conformity with CE (2014/53/EU, RED), UN ECE R10, UN ECE R118 directives."
