  "overview": [
    "NB2800-LWac-G is produced for vehicles used to carry passengers and cargo on highways. It is used to enable the vehicle to be connected to the internet seamlessly and to provide wireless internet access within the vehicle.",
    "It is equipped with a single GSM module with 4G-LTE support, single WiFi access point with IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) standard, GNSS for positioning and two Gigabit Ethernet ports.",
    "Complies with UNECE-R10 (E-Mark) and UNECE-R118 regulations. With its numerous features and high performance; It is the ideal router for applications such as WiFi for Passengers, Passenger Infotainment System, Fleet Management or Security Cameras.",
    "The embedded Linux operating system, developed according to its intended use, has proven software components, including advanced communication protocols. Custom applications can be developed using the free Software Development Kit (SDK)."
  ],
  "keyFeatures": [
    "A GSM module supporting 4G LTE in the device can establish a cellular network connection. Having 4 SIM card slots provides the opportunity to connect to different cellular networks. This helps control mobile internet costs and establish internet connection.",
    "It is resistant to the harsh physical conditions that vehicles produced for passenger and freight transportation will encounter. It has an IP40 level protected design. It operates between -25°C and +70°C.",
    "The advanced GPS receiver makes it easy to determine the vehicle's geographic location information with high accuracy. The minimum number of satellites that need to be fixed for high accuracy in position determination can be programmed.",
    "The device is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet ports for creating a local area network (LAN) within the vehicle. The RJ45 port in the vehicle can be used for internet access of other devices with Ethernet interface (such as vehicle computer, validator).",
    "Thanks to the integrated ignition detection, the router can remain powered on for the time you specify after the vehicle is turned off. Thus, the device safely completes its tasks.",
    "It has certificates of conformity with CE (2014/53/EU, RED), UN ECE R10, UN ECE R118 directives."
