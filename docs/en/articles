        "text": "Vehicle technology supported by adaptive hardware and software infrastructures is called ‘connected vehicle’. In these vehicle systems, vehicles are enabled to communicate in some way with the communication protocols used today. Through protocols such as 4.5G, Bluetooth and Edge, instant data flow can be obtained on many subjects, from mechanical systems to features personalized for the driver. Web-based or mobile applications integrated with the system facilitate drivers' data management.",

Instant sharing of all instant data collected in the vehicle, from mechanical systems to the number of passengers carried, from the location of the vehicle to its speed, with the information processing systems in and outside the vehicle and providing two-way data communication between the vehicle and the information processing systems constitute the basis of connected vehicle systems. It is provided with the help of modern wireless communication technologies such as 5G and 4G for high-speed instantaneous data flow. Interaction with the driver and other users is provided with the help of the internet interface or mobile applications. In fact, it can even be said that vehicles are being transformed into mobile data centers with the help of Connectivity vehicle solutions."

For example, if passengers leave their seats while driving a school bus, both the driver and the operations officers who monitor the fleet can be warned simultaneously. With the help of images taken from the camera monitoring the driver, it can be monitored to what extent the driver pays attention to the road and driving. When it is detected that the driver is talking on the mobile phone while driving, a notification is sent to the relevant persons."

        "text": "Artificial intelligence also improves the passenger experience in public transportation. For example, passengers can monitor the estimated time of arrival at the next stop on the screens in the vehicle or on their own mobile devices. Artificial intelligence algorithms, which provide service with the help of information systems outside the vehicle, calculate the estimated arrival time to the target using the instantaneous traffic density on the route followed by the vehicle, the vehicle's current location and speed data."

WiFi-5/WiFi-6 support provides passengers in the vehicle with the opportunity to benefit from mobile internet connection and connect to the wireless network in the vehicle. With the help of BLE technology, a connection is established with the sensors and actuators in the vehicle. The CAN connection provides the ability to read or modify all data on the vehicle's CANBus bus. With GNNS, the geographical location of the vehicle is determined. Large data storage capacity is provided with high-capacity SSD. With LXC support, a virtual computer is created within the router that uses the resources of the router without the need for another computer in the vehicle. Application-specific automation can be developed with SDK support."
