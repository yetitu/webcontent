While facilitating device connectivity, eUICC also enables the possibility to change mobile subscriptions. Additionally, an eUICC can contain multiple profiles, meaning subscriptions, which helps to mitigate roaming costs. The loading and management of eUICC for machine communication are controlled by the mobile operator. To load another profile, a connection between the customer management systems of both network operators is necessary. This process is not standardized. In the NG800 series, an eUICC solution compliant with GSMA Standard SGP.22 is utilized. This solution is also known as Consumer eSIM. Unlike smartphones, there is no need to scan a QR code.
